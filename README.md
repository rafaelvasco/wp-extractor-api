# WordPress Content Extractor API

Extracts all Posts of a type from a WordPress Website via REST API with support for long-running requests through asynchronous processing.

## Stack

- Flask
- BeautifulSoup
- Gunicorn (Production WSGI Server)
- Celery (Async Task Processing)
- Redis (Message Broker)

## Quick Start

### Development Mode

```bash
python main.py
```

### Production Mode with Async Support

```bash
# Using Docker Compose (recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Or using the startup script
./start_async_dev.sh
```

## API Endpoints

### Synchronous (for small extractions)

- `POST /extract` - Extract content synchronously

### Asynchronous (for large extractions, 100+ seconds)

- `POST /extract/async` - Start async extraction task
- `GET /extract/status/<task_id>` - Check task progress

### Health & Debug

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /debug/redis` - Test Redis connection
- `GET /debug/celery` - Check worker status

## Example Usage

### Async Extraction (Recommended for large sites)

```bash
# Start extraction
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/extract/async \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "baseUrl": "https://large-wordpress-site.com",
    "postType": "posts"
  }'

# Check progress
curl https://your-domain.com/extract/status/[task-id]
```
